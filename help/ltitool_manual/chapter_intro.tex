This particular toolbox is designed to facilitate the teaching, learning  and comprehension process of the linear control theory applyed to linear time invariant  (LTI) systems.

For this reason, this user manual makes use of classical theoretical concepts of linear control systems, based particularly on the work of Adam \cite{Adam2018}. \ footnote {Where the entire nomenclature is based on the cited text.}
 
This toolbox has 5 sections where the it is possible study
\begin{enumerate}
	\item Properties of open loop linear system as poles-zeros of transfer function and their relation to the dynamic responses to step and impulse.
	\item a first introduction to the analysis of linear systems with unit feedback, which includes pole and zero maps of the open and closed loop system, root locus, frequency analysis (Bode and Nyquist diagrams), 	dynamic responses of the feedback system to step set-point changes.
	\item 
	\item
