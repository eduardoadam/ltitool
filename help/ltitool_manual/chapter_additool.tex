\chapter{Additional Tools for LTI System Control} \label{additool_chapter}


This chapter includes additional tools for LTI system control. These are, Optimal Tuning of  PID Controller, among others that they are in development.

\section{Optimal Setting of PID Controller}

\section{Developed Additional Tools}

\subsection{PID Optimal Controller Setting}

Fig. \ref{chpADDITOOL_fig01_ejemOptimalPID} show the developed main window for tuning PID controller based on mixed criteria. For that, the minimization of ITAE, maximum overshoot and sensitivity function was chosen.

Figure \ref{chpADDITOOL_fig02_ejemOptimalPID} shows simulations an results obtained in this example.
